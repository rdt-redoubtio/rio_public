## Background

Lend some context to individual employees by having them provide a little background about themself by way of introduction.

This is also a great place to cross link to professional social media profiles:

- [LinkdedIn](https://www.linkedin.com)
- [Github](https://www.github.com)

## Responsibilities

In larger organizations the context of an individual can become lost. Not only for the individual, but also for their peers, it can become confusing what their role is within the company. Take some time to explain this.

## Measures of Success

While stating specific or general responsibilities is a good first step, take it a little further and provide clarity to your employee about how their success or failure will be measured:

- Accuracy of financial statements
- Performance of organization on external controls audit
- Financial performance of department based on budgeting

### Development Goals

If appropriate, it might be good to also document professional development goals. Sometimes, this level of information might allow a peer to reach out and assist their team mate with a challenging new topic/certification/skill, having already mastered it themselves.
