Many organizations struggle to structure their internal communications. While larger CRM systems (SharePoint, WordPress, etc.) can provide a high level of features, they are often costly, complex and difficult to maintain over time.

Instead consider this template, using static HTML page generation, as a method of easily setting up a basic Internal Website for your company, department or small business. Don't miss out on the opportunity to provide a "one stop shop" for on-boarding new people into the organization and helping them reduce the stress and awkwardness of a first day at a new job.

## Help New Employees Onboard

This is a great place to put some basic information about the company, its culture, its workflows and other information to help bootstrap new employees.
